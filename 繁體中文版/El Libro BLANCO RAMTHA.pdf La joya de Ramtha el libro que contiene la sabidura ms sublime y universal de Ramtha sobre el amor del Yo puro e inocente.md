- You create your reality. Ramtha says that reality is not fixed or objective, but rather a reflection of your consciousness. You attract what you focus on, whether positive or negative. You can change your reality by changing your beliefs, attitudes, and emotions.
- You are responsible for your life. Ramtha says that you are not a victim of circumstances, but rather a co-creator of your destiny. You have free will and choice in every moment, and you can choose to act from love or fear. You also have to face the consequences of your actions, which are governed by the law of karma.
- You are immortal. Ramtha says that you are not a physical body, but rather a spiritual being having a human experience. You have lived many lives before this one, and you will live many more after this one. You can access your past and future memories through meditation and intuition.
- You are evolving. Ramtha says that you are not here to suffer or struggle, but rather to learn and grow. You are here to overcome your limitations, to expand your awareness, and to express your uniqueness. You are here to become a master of yourself and your reality.
