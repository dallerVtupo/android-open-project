Mardaani received critical acclaim for its gripping storyline, realistic portrayal of human trafficking, and powerful performances by the cast, especially Rani Mukerji. The film was praised for its feminist message and its depiction of a strong female protagonist who does not need a male hero to save her. Rani Mukerji was lauded for her convincing and compelling portrayal of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a role that was tailor-made for her. She displayed a range of emotions, from vulnerability to fierceness, and delivered some memorable dialogues with conviction. She also performed her own stunts and action scenes, proving her versatility as an actor.
 
The film also featured a remarkable debut by Tahir Raj Bhasin as Karan Rastogi, the young and ruthless villain who challenges Shivani at every step. He played his character with subtlety and charisma, making him a worthy adversary for Shivani. He also managed to create a sense of menace and unpredictability with his calm and composed demeanor. The supporting cast, including Jisshu Sengupta as Shivani's husband, Anant Vidhaat Sharma as Sunny Katyal, Mona Ambegaonkar as Meenu Rastogi, and Priyanka Sharma as Pyaari, also did justice to their roles.
 
Mardaani was directed by Pradeep Sarkar, who is known for his films like Parineeta and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. He showed a different side of his filmmaking skills with Mardaani, which was a departure from his usual style of romantic dramas. He handled the sensitive subject of child trafficking with sensitivity and maturity, without resorting to sensationalism or melodrama. He also maintained a tight grip on the narrative, keeping the audience engaged and invested in Shivani's journey. The film had a realistic and gritty look, thanks to the cinematography by Artur Zurawski and the editing by Sanjib Datta. The music by Salim-Sulaiman and Julius Packiam was minimal and effective, complementing the mood of the film.
