## What is KMSpico?
 
KMSpico is a software that can activate the final versions of Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 and Office 2010/2013/2016/2019/2021. It does not require user intervention, the entire activation process takes place in the background, just run the tool and wait for the activation status to be updated.
 
KMSpico works by creating a local Key Management Service (KMS) server on your PC, which mimics the original Microsoft server. This way, your Windows and Office products can be activated as if they were connected to a genuine KMS server.
 
KMSpico is 100% clean and safe to use. It does not contain any virus or malware, and it does not modify any system files. It only creates a temporary KMS server and deletes it after activation.
 
## How to Install and Use KMSpico?
 
Before you install and use KMSpico, you need to disable your antivirus or Windows Defender temporarily. This is because some antivirus programs may detect KMSpico as a potential threat and block its operation. Don't worry, this is a false positive and KMSpico is harmless.
 
After disabling your antivirus or Windows Defender, follow these steps to install and use KMSpico:
 
1. Download KMSpico 10.2.1 Final from the official website or from a trusted source.
2. Extract the ZIP file using the password inside Password.txt file.
