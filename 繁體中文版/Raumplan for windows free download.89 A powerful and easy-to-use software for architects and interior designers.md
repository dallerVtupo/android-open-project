Raumplan is a concept of designing spaces that was introduced by the architect Adolf Loos in the 1930s. It is based on the idea that every space has different needs and different height requirements, and that the spaces should be connected in a way that creates a smooth and dynamic flow. Raumplan is not about drawing floor plans, facades or sections, but about thinking in three dimensions and creating spatial experiences.
 
If you are interested in using raumplan for your own projects, you might be wondering if there is a software that can help you with that. The answer is yes, there are some programs that can assist you with creating 3D models of your spaces using raumplan principles. One of them is RAUMPLAN-3D Plus[^1^], a software developed by Harald Scheimzuber that allows you to design rooms, anterooms, terraces and more. You can also add furniture, materials, lighting and textures to your models and view them from different perspectives.

RAUMPLAN-3D Plus is compatible with Windows operating systems and can be downloaded from Software Informer[^1^]. However, it is not a free software, and you will need to purchase a license to use it. The latest version of RAUMPLAN-3D Plus is 2.0 and it was updated on July 10, 2020. If you are looking for a free alternative, you might want to check out raumplan\_for\_windows\_free\_89\_pu[^3^], a package on npm that claims to be a raumplan software for windows. However, there is not much information about this package and it might not be reliable or safe to use.
 
If you want to learn more about raumplan and how it works, you can read some articles or books on the topic. For example, you can visit Constructing Architect[^2^], a website that explains what raumplan is and how Adolf Loos used it in his famous Villa MÃ¼ller. You can also watch some videos or tutorials on YouTube that show how to use raumplan software or how to apply raumplan principles to your own designs.
 
Raumplan is a fascinating and challenging way of thinking about architecture and space. It can help you create unique and functional spaces that suit your needs and preferences. If you are interested in trying it out, you can use some of the software mentioned above or look for other options online. However, remember that raumplan is not about following rules or templates, but about being creative and experimenting with different possibilities.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
One of the advantages of using raumplan software is that you can visualize your spaces in 3D and see how they look from different angles. You can also make changes and adjustments easily and see how they affect the overall design. This can help you avoid mistakes and save time and money in the construction process. You can also share your models with others and get feedback or suggestions.
 
However, using raumplan software also has some limitations and challenges. One of them is that raumplan software might not be able to capture the complexity and subtlety of raumplan design. Raumplan is not only about the shape and size of the spaces, but also about the materials, textures, colors, lighting and atmosphere that create the spatial experience. These aspects might be difficult to represent or simulate in a digital model. Therefore, you might need to complement your software with other tools or methods, such as sketches, drawings, physical models or site visits.
 
Another challenge of using raumplan software is that it might not be compatible with other software or formats that are commonly used in architecture or engineering. For example, you might not be able to export your raumplan model to a CAD program or a BIM system that are used for technical drawings or calculations. You might also have difficulties in communicating your raumplan design to contractors, builders or clients who are not familiar with raumplan concept or software. Therefore, you might need to find ways to translate or adapt your raumplan model to other formats or standards that are more widely accepted or understood.
