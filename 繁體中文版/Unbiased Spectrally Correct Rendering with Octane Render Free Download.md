If you want to try Octane Render for free, you have a few options. One option is to use the OctaneRender Cloud service, which allows you to scale your rendering on demand using OTOY's cloud GPUs. You can sign up for a free trial account and get 20 free render credits per month. You can also access the OctaneRender Cloud from within various DCC plugins, such as Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya, and more.
 
Another option is to download the OctaneRender standalone version from OTOY's website[^1^]. You can get a free tier license that lets you use up to two GPUs for rendering. However, this license has some limitations, such as no network rendering, no animation support, no plugin integration, and no access to OctaneRender Enterprise features. You will also need to create an OTOY account and activate your license online.
 
A third option is to download OctaneRender from unofficial sources, such as torrent sites or file sharing platforms. However, this option is not recommended, as it may expose you to legal risks, malware infections, or corrupted files. Moreover, you will not be able to update your software or get technical support from OTOY. Therefore, it is better to stick with the official sources and respect the terms of service of OctaneRender.
 
OctaneRender is a great tool for creating stunning images and animations with realistic lighting and materials. If you want to experience its power and speed for free, you can choose one of the options mentioned above. However, if you want to unlock its full potential and enjoy its latest features and updates, you may want to consider purchasing a paid license from OTOY or one of its authorized resellers.
  
If you are wondering how to install and use OctaneRender, here are some steps to follow. First, you need to download the OctaneRender installer from OTOY's website and run it on your computer. You will need to agree to the license agreement and choose the installation location. You will also need to install the CUDA drivers for your GPU, if you haven't done so already.
 
Next, you need to launch OctaneRender and log in with your OTOY account. You will then see a dialog box where you can activate your license. You can choose between a free tier license or a paid license, depending on your needs. You will also need to select the GPUs that you want to use for rendering. Once you activate your license, you can start using OctaneRender.
