## Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope
 
Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope is the first and main game in the collection. It follows the adventures of Shovel Knight, a brave and noble knight who fights with a shovel. He was once part of a duo with Shield Knight, his partner and love interest, but they were separated when they explored the Tower of Fate, a mysterious and cursed place. There, they encountered the Enchantress, a powerful and evil sorceress who rules over the land with an iron fist. Shield Knight was corrupted by the Enchantress's magic, and Shovel Knight was knocked out and left for dead.
 
Shovel Knight wakes up to find that the Enchantress has unleashed her army of knights, known as the Order of No Quarter, to terrorize the kingdom. He decides to take up his shovel again and stop the Enchantress and her minions, hoping to find and save Shield Knight along the way. He must travel through various regions, each guarded by a different member of the Order of No Quarter, and face many dangers and obstacles. He can also visit villages and meet friendly characters who can help him with items, upgrades, and tips.
 
Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope is a homage to classic NES games like Mega Man, Castlevania, DuckTales, and Zelda II. It has a simple but effective gameplay system that involves running, jumping, digging, bouncing, and attacking with the shovel. The shovel can also be used to interact with the environment, such as breaking blocks, digging up treasure, flipping switches, and deflecting projectiles. The game has a high level of difficulty that requires skill and precision, but it also has a fair and rewarding design that encourages exploration and experimentation.
 
The game also has a charming and humorous story that is told through dialogue, cutscenes, and dream sequences. The characters are memorable and quirky, each with their own personality and backstory. The game also has a lot of secrets and easter eggs that reference other games and media. The game has a retro aesthetic that mimics the limitations and style of the NES era, but with some modern enhancements. The graphics are colorful and detailed, with smooth animations and parallax scrolling. The music is catchy and atmospheric, composed by Jake Kaufman and Manami Matsumae.
 
## Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows
 
Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows is the first expansion for Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope. It lets you play as Plague Knight, one of the villains from the original game. Plague Knight is an alchemist who wears a plague doctor mask and uses bombs as his weapons. He is part of the Order of No Quarter, but he has his own agenda: he wants to create the Ultimate Potion, a powerful concoction that can grant any wish. To do so, he needs to collect the essences of his fellow knights, including Shovel Knight.
 
Plague Knight must follow the same path as Shovel Knight did in Shovel of Hope, but with some differences. He can use his bombs to blast through enemies and obstacles, as well as propel himself in the air. He can also customize his bombs by changing their casing, powder, fuse, and burst type. He can also collect coins to buy new bomb parts or trade them for other items. He can also visit his secret hideout in the Potionarium, where he can talk to his allies Mona (his assistant) and Percy (his engineer), as well as play a mini-game called Bomb Burst.
 
Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows is a remix of Shovel of Hope that adds new gameplay mechanics, levels, bosses, items, secrets, and story elements. It has a different difficulty curve that requires mastering Plague Knight's unique abilities and bomb combinations. It also has a different tone that focuses on Plague Knight's motivations and relationships with other characters. The game also has some new music tracks composed by Jake Kaufman.
 
## Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment
 
Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment is the second expansion for Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope. It is a prequel that tells the origin story of Specter Knight, another villain from the original game. Specter Knight is a reaper who wields a scythe and can manipulate darkness. He was once a human named Donovan, a friend and rival of Luan (King Knight's father). They were treasure hunters
